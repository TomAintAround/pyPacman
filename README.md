# pyPacman

This repository is a project that I had to do in my University course called Introdução à Programação e Resolução de Problemas (Introduction to Programming and Problem Solving).

Because this was made in a Portuguese University, the code, variable names and comments are all in Portuguese.

## How the game works

To launch the game, run `python principal_alunos.py`, so make sure you have Python 3.12 (preferably 3.12.7). If you have nix installed, you can run `nix develop` to install all packages you need. It will prompt you to pick a save file, but just clicking enter will pick the default one. This will be covered later.

You are the yellow guy and your objective is to eat all the dots around the map by moving into them (using the arrow keys) while also not touching any of the 4 ghosts:
1. Inky, the cyan ghost who moves randomly
2. Blinky, the red ghost who also moves randomly
3. Pinky, the pink ghost who is constantly chasing you.
4. Clyde, the orange ghost who chases you until he gets too close.

You can also save the game into a file by pressing the "S" key. When launching the game, you can then select which save file to use.
